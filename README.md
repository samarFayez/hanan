Khobza is a web app that is meant to help GSG staff and visitors order sandwiches
from the cafeteria of GSG during the lunchtime. 
The main focus of the app is to eliminate distraction resulting from leaving one's desk to get a sandwich.
With our app, the users will save time and effort.


Khobza allows a customer to select sandwich from the GSG cafeteria. 
If the sandwich does not exist, the app provides users with the names of nearby restaurants along with their phone numbers so that users can choose
a restaurant to order from.  

Our app gives the user the ability to customize their order through the 'notes' option we provide with the 'cofirm order' page.

## How to use our app:
Get an account on our app. Go to the registration page and sign up. 
Login, and browse the sandwiches. 

Once you choose a sandwich and happy with your order, you can
confirm your order by clicking on the cart icon and then clicking confirm so
that your order is confirmed.
Click on the notification icon to browse your ready orders.
